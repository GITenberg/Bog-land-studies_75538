    <div class="verse indent0">If so happen—an’ ready enough ’tis to happen—a bad saison came.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Yet ’twas just be the raison of him, Misther Denis, the throuble began.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For afore ye’d believe he shot up from a slip of a boy to a man;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not his match in the counthry, sez we; an’ th’ ould master he thought that the lad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bet creation, because, ye percaive, it was all o’ the childher he had,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ the misthress had died on thim both. So ’twas rael bad luck to befall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When young master tuk into his head to be off and away from us all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ to make of his fortin in ’Sthralia. Och, sure he’d one made fit an’ fine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But some money they owned, I’ve heard said, had got all swallied up in a mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ that gave him the notion; an’ thin there’s the world young chaps fancy to see.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So th’ ould master was fairly disthracted, an’ couldn’t abide the idee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he done all he could to pervint of his goin’ an’ coax him to stay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he got him the natest half-decker that ever was sailed in our bay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ for huntin’ a mare that ’ud frighten the Saints wid the leps that she’d lep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A grand baste—but no ha’porth o’ use; Misther Denis he wouldn’t be kep’,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ the sorra a thing good or bad ’ud persuade him to bide here contint,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">It’s a full ten year oulder he looked from that day. Howsomedever, at first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We thried puttin’ the best face we could on the matter, an’ talkin’ a dale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of how soon he’d be wid us agin; an’ thin letters ’ud come by the mail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wid discripshins of all Misther Denis was seein’ an’ doin’ out there,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When we’d sit on the pier afther work, an’ ’ud read us out bits of his news</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From Austhraly; an’ thin we’d get gabbin’ together like say-gulls an’ mews</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whin they’re fishin’ an’ fightin’, of all Misther Denis ’ud do out of han’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once he come home as rich as a Jew; the good stock that he’d put on the lan’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ the fields he’d be dhrainin’; bedad, we’d the whole of it settled an’ planned,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the names o’ the cows, an’ which side o’ the yard the new cart-shed ’ud stand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why, one night young Pat Byrne an’ Joe Murphy they set to an’ boxed up an’ down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">About which o’ thim both’d get the job to look afther the greyhounds he’d own—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For we knew Misther Denis ’d be sartin to keep an odd few in the place—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ th’ ould master seemed rael diverted, an’ gave thim a shillin’ apiece.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We began to misdoubt some bad luck, till at last we done worse than misdoubt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the throuble crep’ closer each day; so I’ve watched a fog dhrift up the shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wipin’ out one by one every field glintin’ green in the sun just before.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ to my mind that throuble’s the worst, whin the time keeps jog-throttin’ along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ because nothin’ happens at all, ye get certiner somethin’s gone wrong.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For if grief’s to befall ye, I’d liefer ’twould lape on ye suddint when laste</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That’ill send the death crawlin’ in could thro’ your limbs. But ’twas just such a thing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wid the young master’s letters. For, first time one missed, all we said was the post</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had delayed it belike; an’ next mail-day we said one might aisy be lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Comin’ that far; an’ time an’ agin we’d be sayin’: ‘Och, musha, if aught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would ha’ happint him, some one’d ha’ wrote fast enough wid the news’; but we thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was quare. Till at last we were dhruv to believe that he’d surely been tuk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wid some fever, or met wid a hurt, and be thravellin’ far off, be bad luck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And had died all alone, wid the sorra a friend to be sendin’ home word;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">An’ he wouldn’t let on he thought bad o’ the matter; an’ yet all the same,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’d be off wid himself in the boat to the town every mornin’ that came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like enough wid no chance in the world o’ the mail bein’ in, as he knew;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he’d set Widdy Doyle at the office a-sortin’ the letter-bags thro’,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ stan’ watchin’ as if one ’ud make all the differ ’twixt Heaven and Hell;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ it never was Heaven; for always there’d be the same story to tell:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>

    <div class="verse indent0">I remember one day we made sure there was news, for the boat we espied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wid the boys rowin’ mad, fit to reave the ould thole-pins clear out of her side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An’ Long Mick, the big fool, lettin’ bawls in the bows, and a-wavin’ the bag,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Cause a velopy’d come wid a sthrange-coloured stamp, an’ they’d settled to brag</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">On the railroads in France; an’ that mornin’ there wasn’t a word of abuse</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">So the years slipt away an’ away, an’ no news to be had good or ill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But it’s more than the years, I’ll go bail, did be dhrivin’ th’ ould master down-hill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas the wond’rin’, an’ wishin’, an’ frettin’ that whitened the hair on his head,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">On’y Jack had more sinse in him yet than meself that was hearty and sound;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For he looked towards the rim of the west wid the sun hangin’ ready to fall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he whistled two notes quick and low—well I knew it: the curlew’s call.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">I’d not aisy mistake it; sure out on these bogs scarce a minit goes by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But anear or afar on the win’ comes a flicker of the crathur’s cry—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faith, I heard wan just thin—and on many a day, ere the sun ’ud be up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And around and around stood the grey of the air like a big empty cup</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fit to hold every sound ever stirred, and to catch all the light ever shone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’d be out wid me on to our bogland, all desolit lyin’, and lone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the say whin you’ve watched the low shore till it dips where the ridges rowl green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’d spy was there e’er a wan out, and belike not a sowl to be seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save Jack whistlin’ away to me down be the lough; you ’d ha’ swore ’twas the bird,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Barrin’ just the laste differ; Jack done it the likest that ever I heard.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there’s plenty that thry at it. Seldom a sunsit throops out of the west</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But some lad ’ll be whistlin’ his sweetheart, that’s sittin’ and listenin’ her best,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While the corners grow dark, and she’s reckonin’ the shadows for ’fraid he might fail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So his call lit the world like a star. Ne’er a sweetheart had Jack, I’ll go bail,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the truth is his mind was tuk up wid his own folk; it couldn’t be tould</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The opinion he had and consait of the whole of thim, young wans and ould,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And it’s there where I’m bothered entirely to think how he got the idee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To go soldierin’ off to the ends of the earth wid no comrade but me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Howanever, he went of a suddint, afore we knew right what was on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I thought to meself the ould place ’ud be quare wid Jack Connolly gone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So I up and I down to the barracks below, an’ the shillin’ I tuk—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That’s the way it fell out, and belike ’twas himself had the best of the luck.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And continted and aisy he went, wanst he saw he’d made shift to conthrive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That the message he had in his mind ’ud go safe. For sez I: ‘Man alive,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll be tellin’ your people at home the first chance I can git, good or bad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How thimselves, and the ould place you quit, was the last thought that ever you had;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’ll bid thim be thinkin’ of you, whin they hear the bird cry on our bog.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your poor mother, an’ father, an’ the childher, an’ their little ould rogue of a dog,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er a wan you’re forgettin’,’ sez I; and bedad any fool might ha’ known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the manin’ he meant wid his call was as clear as a bugle blown.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And our rifles wint crack be the gateway, and now and agin wid a plop</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come a bullet dhruv deep in the sand—’twas the divil dhrill-sowin’ his crop—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a priest legged it up to the top of the tower, and stood risin’ a yell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the rest to be sayin’ their prayers, like as if ’twas our angely bell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But it’s little Jack heeded; for sure his own folk, and th’ ould counthry, and all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were come nearer than near, and gone further than far, along wid that curlew’s call.</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Ah, but Norah, you’re perished an’ thrimblin’ wid could, sittin’ here in the win’;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did you bring ne’er a wrap to rowl round you, machree, now the night’s closin’ in?</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For there’s mists curlin’ white on the pools, and the air gits an edge whin they lift.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ay, the moon’s up, just on’y a breath ’gin the blue, where the cloud comes adrift,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sthreelin’ by like a haystack on fire, wid the flame blowin’ off be the way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In bright bundles and wisps, as if some wan ’ud harvest the light of the day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tisn’t that fashion dark falls, out there in the aist. Wanst the sun goes on lave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne’er a thrace of a glame bides to show where he passed, like the foam of a wave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’ll be blazin’ wan minit, and thin ’tis the same as if somebody shut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A black door on the blink of a hearth, or kicked over a lamp wid his fut.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So the rest of us rode thro’ a night blindin’ dark, till we’d half the plain crossed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the moon riz ice-clear, wid a shine lyin’ thick on the grass as hoar-frost,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">You could gather up. And, troth, if our tongues had froze stiff, ’tis as much we’d ha’ said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wid Jack Connolly’s baste saddle-empty, and jerkin’ the reins as I led.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sure poor Jack had a dale of good-nature; he’d fooled the ould mare all he could,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the crathur went slow-fut and heavy; you might think that she understood.</div>
